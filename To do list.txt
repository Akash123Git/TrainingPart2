Hi Lalith,

I am Akash A from Bootcamp Batch-87. I have made a mistake while filling the time sheet from 30/08/2021 to 09/09/2021.
I have filled it as "Audit" instead of "Traning". It wasn't until last firday 17/09/2021 evening 7:00PM I got to know about this.
I had sent a Mail regarding the issue to the IAMT, they informed me to cancel the timesheet and refill it again but the Timesheet is
already approved.

I apologise for my mistake, I will make sure the same doesn't happen again.
Can I know the further actions to be taken to resolve this issue.

Thank you,
